# Kickstarter Analysis Using Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is utilizing Microsoft Excel to analyse crowdfunding data called Kickstarter data, for an up-and-coming playwrite, Louise. Louise is starting her own crowfunding project to fund her play Fever. We will be performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover crowdfunding trends to help Louise successfully fund her play.

### Purpose
To analyse the crowdfunding data to determine if there are specific factors that makes a crowdfunding campaign successful. In addition, we will provide analysis and visuals to show how different campaigns performed based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
We started our initial analysis with an Excel file with [crowdfunding data] (data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx). Within that file, the tab called Category Statistics, contains analysis on Parent Category Outcomes. The theater category has the most crowdfunding projects and the most successful outcomes, the stacked bar chart [Parent Category Outcomes](ParentCategoryOutcomes.png) illustrates this. Within the subcateogries, we found that plays dominated all crowdfunding projects with over 1k in total funded projects and a 65% success rate, refer to the stacked column chart [Subcategory Outcomes](SubcategoryOutcomes.png) to see the full list. Our line chart [Monthly Outcomes] (MonthlyOutcomeTrends.png) shows that the months between May and July is the best time to start a crowdfunding theater projects and November and Decemeber is the worst months to start a crowdfunding project. May is the best month to start a crowdfunding project with a success rate of 67% compared to only 49% in December, which is the worst month to start a crowdfunding project. 

The challenges Louise might face is the outcomes we have presented are based on ALL countries. Hence, depending on where she's located our findings might be slightly or drastically different. Hence, we recommend that she use our [crowdfunding data] (data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx) to do a more detail analysis for her own country.

With our initial findings Louise came close to her fundraising goals. We then provided Louise with the [Kickstarter Challenge] (Kickstarter_Challenge.zip) file to show her how different campaigns performed based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The [Theater Outcomes Vs Launch Date](Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) line chart illustrates that for theater projects the best time to fund the project is in May and the worst time is December. With May outperforming December by 121% in total projects funded. Also the success rate is also 17% higher in May at 67% compared to only 50% in December. Failure rate is also 15% less in May at 31% compared to 46% in December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The [Outcomes Vs Goals](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) line chart illustrates that projects with less than $5K goals tend to fair much better than projects with goals greater than $45K. Her goals should be around $1K to $5K because the success rate is 86%, which is the best performing goal category. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The exercises were pretty straight forward and not very challenging. However, I find the instructions lacking in some areas. Errors in the instructions made it difficult at times to complete the exercises. Also, I find myself reading and re-reading alot of the exercises to make sure I have done everything correctly. Hence, I think the instructions can be tweaked a little to make it easier to follow and understand.

## Results
In conclusion, Louise should launch her crowdfunding preferrable in May because May outperformed all other months. If that is not possible, she should launch in the summer months vs November or December, the 2 worst months of the year to start a crowdfunding theater project. Her goal should be between $1k to $5K, with a 86% success rate and she should stay away from anything higher than  $45K. The failure rate for projects between $45,000 and $49,999 is at 100%.

### Limitations

This dataset provides a general overview of all the crowdfunding projects globally. Louise should drill down to her country's dataset to help her get better analysis on crowdfunding data.

### Additional Resources
We could redo most of the charts for her specific country. In addtion, it would be nice to see how the project length plays a role in the outcome. Hence, a line chart for Theater Outcomes based on project lengths.
